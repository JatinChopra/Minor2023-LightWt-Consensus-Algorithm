# Minor2023-LightWt-Consensus-Algorithm

Welcome to the Minor2023 LightWeight Consensus Algorithm project repository. In this project, I explore various consensus algorithms, study their principles, and build my own lightweight consensus algorithm. The project aims to provide a better understanding of blockchain consensus mechanisms and to create a new algorithm to compare with established ones.

## Project Overview

This project focuses on creating a lightweight consensus algorithm for blockchain systems. It involves in-depth research, development, and comparison of different consensus mechanisms. The primary objectives of the project are:

- Study well-known consensus algorithms like [Proof of Work (PoW)](consensus-algorithms/pow), [Proof of Stake (PoS)](consensus-algorithms/pos), [Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)](consensus-algorithms/pbft), and more.

- Develop a new lightweight consensus algorithm by incorporating the best features from existing algorithms and addressing their limitations.

- Compare the new algorithm with previously built ones to evaluate its performance and efficiency.

## Implemented Consensus Algorithms

This project has implemented and studied the following consensus algorithms:

- [**Proof of Work (PoW)**](consensus-algorithms/pow)

- [**Proof of Stake (PoS)**](consensus-algorithms/pos)

- [**Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT)**](consensus-algorithms/pbft)

- [**Proof of Work and Proof of Stake Hybrid**](consensus-algorithms/powpos-hybrid)
